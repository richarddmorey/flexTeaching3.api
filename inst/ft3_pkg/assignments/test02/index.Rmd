## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## RNG

```{r}
rnorm(10)
```


$$
  x = y
$$


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## pars

```{r eval=TRUE}
params$flexTeaching_pars
```
